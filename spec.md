# ÐMP — Dogenals Marketplace Protocol Specification

Version: v1.0 (Draft)
Status: Pre-launch draft
Last Updated: 2026-05-08
Chain: Dogecoin (and compatible Dogecoin-fork chains)
**Canonical repo:** [github.com/jonheaven/dmp-spec](https://github.com/jonheaven/dmp-spec)

ÐMP is part of the first Dogenals launch drop. It has not been minted or battle-tested as a Dogenals protocol yet;
implementations SHOULD treat it as a precise target for independent testing.

### Naming (informative)

- **Display name (user-facing):** **ÐMP** (Dogenals Marketplace Protocol).
- **Canonical public spec:** this repository ([jonheaven/dmp-spec](https://github.com/jonheaven/dmp-spec)).
- **On-chain marker:** `p: "Ð:MP"`.
- **Stable assets:** Schema filenames and `$id` URLs remain unchanged for compatibility.

## 1. Introduction

The Dogenals Marketplace Protocol (ÐMP) is an open, on-chain standard for Dogecoin NFT marketplace actions
encoded as Dogenals inscriptions. ÐMP Intents are permanent receipts for market behavior: list, bid, auction,
offer, counteroffer, accept, decline, settle, cancel, transfer, and collection governance.

ÐMP is an **intent and proof layer**, not an atomic execution layer. Listings declare seller intent; settlements
prove that a valid on-chain transfer occurred. Indexers verify proof against real transaction data. No protocol
mechanism prevents a listing from going stale or a bad actor from skipping settlement — ÐMP makes all of that
auditable and legible, not impossible. See SECURITY.md for the full threat model.

### Design Goals

- Trustless verification from chain data only.
- Portable provenance and full sales history.
- Additive versioning: new fields and ops do not break old parsers.
- UTXO-native ownership verification.
- Strong creator provenance through signatures.
- Honest provenance gap detection — never hide breaks.

### Size Guidelines

ÐMP uses plain, human-readable JSON to maximize transparency and long-term verifiability.

- Implementations SHOULD reject ÐMP inscriptions larger than 4 KB as a soft spam-prevention measure.
- Future versions may introduce optional compact formats using new top-level fields (e.g., `"c"` for
  compression).
- Parsers MUST gracefully ignore unknown formats and fall back to raw JSON whenever possible.

### Versioning

- v1.0 is the launch draft.
- The `v` field MUST be `"1.0"`.
- After public launch, future breaking changes MUST be explicitly versioned and documented.

---

## 2. Terminology

- **Inscription**: Dogenals payload stored on-chain via OP_FALSE OP_IF "ord" script in the first input's
  scriptSig, spread across one or more chained transactions.
- **Inscription ID**: `<txid>i<vout>` where txid is the 64-char lowercase hex transaction ID of the first
  transaction in the inscription chain, and vout is the u32 output index where the inscription sat lands
  (typically 0 for standard single-output inscriptions).
- **ÐMP Intent**: inscription whose JSON includes `p = "Ð:MP"`.
- **Op**: operation type in `op`.
- **Manifest**: collection op with creator signature and criteria.
- **UTXO**: unspent transaction output controlling inscription ownership.
- **Satpoint**: `<outpoint>:<offset>` — the precise sat-level location of an inscription within a UTXO.
- **Koinu**: smallest DOGE unit. 1 DOGE = 100,000,000 koinu.
- **Provenance gap**: state where an inscription's ownership changed without a valid ÐMP settlement/transfer path.
- **Canonical ordering**: tie-breaking order for simultaneous ops: `block_height ASC`, `tx_index_in_block ASC`,
  `output_index ASC`.

---

## 3. Envelope Format

### 3.1 Top-Level Fields

Every ÐMP Intent MUST include:

- `p`: `"Ð:MP"`
- `v`: protocol version string (`"1.0"`)
- `op`: operation identifier

### 3.2 Conventions

- Amounts are decimal integer strings in koinu (e.g., `"100000000"` for 1 DOGE). Where this spec requires a
  **positive** amount, the string MUST match `^[1-9][0-9]*$` (no leading zeros). Implementations MUST reject
  values that do not fit in **unsigned 64-bit** arithmetic (`≤ 2^64 − 1`) to avoid silent overflow in indexers
  (MUST-008).
- Timestamps are Unix epoch seconds (integer).
- `psdt`, when present, MUST be standard base64 (no whitespace) encoding of PSDT bytes.
- Unknown fields MUST be ignored by indexers.
- JSON payload MUST be valid UTF-8.
- The `chain` field, when present, MUST equal `"dogecoin"` for mainnet Dogenals. Indexers SHOULD reject ops
  with `chain` set to any other value when operating on Dogecoin mainnet.
- The `nonce` field (optional, any string) MAY be included on any op to aid deduplication in tooling. It has
  no semantic effect on validation.
- The `sig_msg` field (optional), when present, is the hex-encoded UTF-8 bytes of the canonical JSON that was
  hashed for signing (BEFORE applying the Dogecoin signed-message prefix). This is a convenience field for
  inspection. Indexers MUST NOT accept `sig_msg` as a substitute for canonical recomputation — they MUST
  recompute the canonical payload independently and verify `sig` against it.

### 3.3 Timestamp sanity

- Timestamps in this protocol are Unix epoch **seconds** (integers), usually in field `ts` on each op.
- **MUST-102**: For any op that includes `ts`, indexers MUST reject the op as INVALID if `ts` is outside
  **±7200 seconds (2 hours)** of the **median time past (MTP)** of the block that **confirms** the
  inscription, using the same MTP definition as Dogecoin consensus (BIP113-style). Lightweight indexers
  that only store block header `nTime` MAY use `nTime` instead of MTP for this check **only if** they
  document that deviation; they SHOULD still apply the same ±7200s window.
- **MUST-103**: When comparing `ts` values for protocol logic (e.g. offer/bid expiry vs another op, or
  `settle` timing vs `auction` `expiry`), implementations MUST use the **`ts` field encoded in the relevant
  inscription JSON**, not the containing block’s timestamp, **except** where this spec explicitly requires
  comparing to **MTP(block)** of a confirming block (e.g. MUST-102, MUST-108). This reduces miner skew for
  relative ordering inscribed by users.

## 4. Operations Reference

### 4.1 list

Declares seller intent to sell an inscription.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "list",
  "inscription_id": "<txid>i<vout>",
  "price": "<koinu>",
  "currency": "DOGE",
  "seller": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "listing_type": "fixed_price",
  "auction_mode": "time_based",
  "min_bid_increment": "<koinu>",
  "royalty_address": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "royalty_bps": "500",
  "collection_id": "<collection inscription_id>",
  "expiry": 1800000000,
  "psdt": "<base64 PSDT>",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "nonce": "<optional string>",
  "ts": 1700000000
}
```

#### Notes

- `listing_type` is optional. Allowed values: `fixed_price`, `auction`.
- `auction_mode` is used when `listing_type` is `"auction"`.
- Allowed `auction_mode` values: `time_based`, `seller_can_accept_early`, `no_early_accept`.
- `seller_can_accept_early` allows seller to settle a valid bid before expiry.
- `no_early_accept` forbids any early acceptance; settlement can occur only after expiry.
- A `list` op is a new inscription — it does NOT spend the inscription UTXO being listed. Ownership is
  verified by address-match: `seller` MUST equal the current UTXO owner of `inscription_id` in indexer
  state at the block height of the list inscription. See Section 8.
- **Optional `co_sellers`**: array of Dogecoin addresses. When non-empty, the listing is treated as
  **multi-party** for cancel authorization (MUST-104, MUST-105). When absent or empty, only `seller` is
  required for cancel (subject to Section 8.4).

#### Inline Example (auction list)

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "list",
  "inscription_id": "aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff0000111122223333444455556666777788889999i0",
  "price": "100000000",
  "currency": "DOGE",
  "seller": "D8mZsgKwmSQWYRPEMCcm8KzNFj1JVF5UpA",
  "listing_type": "auction",
  "auction_mode": "seller_can_accept_early",
  "min_bid_increment": "50000000",
  "expiry": 1800000000,
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "ts": 1700001000
}
```

### 4.2 bid

Expresses purchase intent against a listing or auction target.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "bid",
  "inscription_id": "<txid>i<vout>",
  "list_id": "<list inscription_id>",
  "collection_id": "<collection inscription_id>",
  "price": "<koinu>",
  "currency": "DOGE",
  "bidder": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "bid_fee": "<koinu>",
  "fee_recipient": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "expiry": 1800000000,
  "psdt": "<base64 PSDT>",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "nonce": "<optional string>",
  "ts": 1700000000
}
```

#### Notes

- Either `inscription_id` or `collection_id` MUST be present.
- `list_id` is optional. When present, the bid is explicitly linked to a specific active listing.
  Indexers SHOULD verify the referenced listing is active. When absent, the bid is treated as a
  general intent against `inscription_id` or `collection_id`.
- `bid_fee` is optional in the current draft. Implementations MAY require it for spam resistance.
- If `bid_fee` is present, `fee_recipient` MUST be present.
- Expired bids (where `ts` of bid + expiry window has passed at confirmation time) are INVALID and
  MUST NOT be eligible for settlement.

#### Inline Example

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "bid",
  "inscription_id": "aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff0000111122223333444455556666777788889999i0",
  "price": "1200000000",
  "currency": "DOGE",
  "bidder": "DRPLkFEt5GNQR2xt1GtVBSsTUr63W3mBnq",
  "bid_fee": "100000000",
  "fee_recipient": "D9p4Lk9xvbQ2Dyh4S8vCb9Ly8cY3h8pP1M",
  "expiry": 1700010000,
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "ts": 1700000500
}
```

### 4.3 settle

Records completed transfer and payment settlement. **Any party may inscribe a settle op** — the inscriber
identity is irrelevant to validity. Indexers verify validity entirely from `settlement_txid` on-chain reality.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "settle",
  "inscription_id": "<txid>i<vout>",
  "list_id": "<list inscription_id>",
  "bid_id": "<bid or offer inscription_id>",
  "auction_id": "<auction inscription_id>",
  "seller": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "buyer": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "price": "<koinu>",
  "royalty_paid": "<koinu>",
  "royalty_address": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "platform_fee": "<koinu>",
  "platform_fee_recipient": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "settlement_txid": "<txid>",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "ts": 1700000000
}
```

#### Notes (v1.0 additions)

- `platform_fee` and `platform_fee_recipient` are optional v1.0 fields. When present, indexers SHOULD
  verify these outputs exist in `settlement_txid`.
- **Double-settle prevention**: Only the first valid `settle` op (by canonical ordering) for a given
  `list_id` or `auction_id` is accepted. Subsequent settle ops referencing the same already-settled
  listing are INVALID (idempotent rejection).
- **Confirmation depth**: Indexers MUST NOT treat settlement as confirmed until `settlement_txid`
  has at least 6 confirmed blocks (Dogecoin ~1 min/block). UIs SHOULD display "pending" for
  sub-threshold settlements. Indexers MAY configure a different depth; 6 is the recommended minimum.
- **Royalty verification**: `royalty_paid` MUST be >= `floor(price * royalty_bps / 10000)`. Indexers
  MUST verify this against actual outputs in `settlement_txid`. Implementers MUST compute
  `floor(price * royalty_bps / 10000)` using **big integers** or a safe order of operations so
  `price * royalty_bps` does not overflow 64-bit intermediates before the floor.
- **No self-sale (`settle`)**: `buyer` MUST NOT equal `seller` (exact string equality on addresses). Use
  `transfer` for non-sale moves; wash-style same-address “sales” are INVALID.
- **Reference consistency**: If `list_id` is present, the referenced `list` op’s `inscription_id` MUST equal
  this settle’s `inscription_id`. If `auction_id` is present, the referenced `auction` op’s `inscription_id`
  MUST equal this settle’s `inscription_id`.
- **Listing seller match (when `list_id` or `auction_id` is present)**: `seller` on this settle MUST equal the
  `seller` field on that `list` or `auction` op (the listing being closed). (Offer-driven settles that omit
  both MAY rely on MUST-031/MUST-032 only; see §15.3.)
- **`bid_id` and offers**: `bid_id` MAY reference a `bid`, an `offer`, an `accept`, or (when resolving
  negotiation) a `counteroffer` per MUST-099–MUST-101. (The patch draft called this `offer_id`; v1.0 wire uses
  **`bid_id`** for all of these.)
- **Zero royalty (MUST-107)**: When **effective** royalty bps is zero (listing, auction, or collection basis
  per MUST-107 in §13.4), `royalty_paid` MUST be absent or **`"0"`**.

#### Inline Example

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "settle",
  "inscription_id": "aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff0000111122223333444455556666777788889999i0",
  "list_id": "f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1i0",

  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "ts": 1700000900
}
```

### 4.4 cancel

Cancels a list, bid, auction, offer, or counteroffer intent.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "cancel",
  "cancel_id": "<target op inscription_id>",
  "cancel_type": "list",
  "canceller": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "reason": "seller_request",
  "sig": "<hex signature>",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "ts": 1700000000
}
```

Allowed `cancel_type` values: `list`, `bid`, `auction`, `offer`, `counteroffer`.

#### Cancel `reason` (MUST-106)

- `reason` is **REQUIRED** on `cancel`.
- **MUST-106**: `reason` MUST be exactly one of: `seller_request`, `expired`, `buyer_breach`,
  `admin_emergency`, `other`.
- Indexers SHOULD surface `reason` in APIs for transparency. Legacy inscriptions using older free-form
  strings (e.g. `price_change`) SHOULD be treated as `seller_request` for display only; **new** inscriptions
  MUST use the enum.
- **Compatibility**: indexers MAY accept `cancel` ops with **missing** `reason` as **non-conforming** legacy
  data (flag in API) but MUST NOT treat them as satisfying MUST-106 for strict v1.0 validation unless
  operators define an explicit legacy cutoff height.

#### Cancel Authorization Model

Cancels MUST be authorized. Two valid methods:

**Method A — UTXO-based (RECOMMENDED)**: The transaction containing the cancel inscription MUST have at
least one input UTXO controlled by the `canceller` address, proving the same party who created the intent
is cancelling it.

**Method B — Signature-based**: The `sig` field contains a Dogecoin signed-message signature (see Section
6 for canonicalization) over the canonical cancel JSON. The recovered signer MUST equal `canceller`.

In both methods, `canceller` MUST equal the authorized party for the target op:
- `list` / `auction` cancel: `canceller` MUST equal `seller` on target op.
- `bid` cancel: `canceller` MUST equal `bidder` on target op.
- `offer` cancel: `canceller` MUST equal `buyer` on target op.
- `counteroffer` cancel: `canceller` MUST equal `seller` on target op.

**v1.0 cancel ops** (without `canceller`): Indexers MUST still validate cancel authorization.
For v1.0 cancel ops, Method A UTXO-based authorization is the required verification path. The cancel
inscription tx input addresses are compared to the authorized party address on the target op.

**UTXO spend auto-invalidation** remains independent of cancel: if the inscription UTXO is spent, the
listing auto-invalidates (MUST-015) regardless of whether a cancel op exists.

#### Multi-co-seller listings and auctions (MUST-104, MUST-105)

When a `list` or `auction` includes a non-empty **`co_sellers`** array:

- **MUST-104 (Method A)**: The transaction that contains the `cancel` inscription MUST include, as inputs,
  at least one UTXO spendable by **`seller`** and at least one UTXO spendable by **each** address in
  `co_sellers` (address-match against standard script types the indexer supports). **Method B (`sig` alone)
  is INVALID** for cancels targeting such a list/auction unless a future multi-signature extension defines an
  aggregate proof.
- **MUST-105**: If **any** of the following is true at the cancel inscription’s confirmation height —
  an **active** `bid` with `list_id` / `auction_id` referencing this list or auction, or an **active**
  `offer` whose optional `list_id` / `auction_id` matches — then **every** address in the set
  `{seller} ∪ co_sellers` MUST satisfy the input requirement in MUST-104 (no partial co-seller cancel
  after negotiation has started on that listing context).

When `co_sellers` is absent or empty, cancel authorization follows Section 8.4 only.

#### Inline Example

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "cancel",
  "cancel_id": "c0ffeec0ffeec0ffeec0ffeec0ffeec0ffeec0ffeec0ffeec0ffeec0ffeec0ffi0",
  "cancel_type": "offer",
  "canceller": "DRPLkFEt5GNQR2xt1GtVBSsTUr63W3mBnq",
  "reason": "seller_request",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "ts": 1700000750
}
```

### 4.5 collection

Defines authoritative collection metadata and membership rules.

#### parent_inscription_id (optional, v1.0)

- **Optional** top-level string: a valid [inscription_id](#2-terminology) of a **parent** inscription
  (for example, a **parent** collection the creator points to for provenance or brand hierarchy).
- **MUST** appear only on a **root** `collection` op (the `collection` inscription that establishes the
  `slug` per this protocol). **MUST NOT** be added, removed, or changed via
  [`collection-update`](#46-collection-update) (including inside `patch`).
- When the same *collection* inscription *also* carries a DRC-721 / DogeRelics Core native
  `parent` key in the *ord* inscription trailer, indexers that implement DRC-721 **MUST** enforce
  [MUST-057](#136-collection): the value **MUST** match the same `parent` as the 36 B wire
  (same ÐMP string id) or the op is **inconsistent** (reject or flag, per policy).
- This ÐMP field is **application metadata** for marketplaces. The on-chain *strong* parent/child
  link remains DogeRelics + UTXO rules (native `parent` tag + UTXO validation).
  A collection without a native ÐMP `parent_inscription_id` and without a DRC-721 `parent` tag is still
  a valid ÐMP `collection` when all other `collection` rules pass.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "collection",
  "slug": "doge-punks",

  "sig": "<hex>",
  "sig_msg": "<hex>",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "ts": 1700000000
}
```

`parent_inscription_id` in this schema block is optional. When present, it **MUST** follow the
[parent_inscription_id (optional, v1.0)](#parent_inscription_id-optional) rules above.

#### default_auction_settings

- Optional collection-level defaults used by wallets/marketplaces as policy hints, not binding overrides.
- `auction_mode` allowed: `time_based`, `seller_can_accept_early`, `no_early_accept`.
- `min_offer_fee` is expressed in koinu and is advisory policy for spam filtering.

}
```

### 4.6 collection-update

Append-only patch update for collection state. The `patch` object **MUST NOT** add, remove, or change
`parent_inscription_id` (or any not-yet-manifested `collection` top-level key reserved for the root
operation). Parent provenance is fixed on the [root `collection` op](#45-collection) only.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "collection-update",
  "collection_id": "<root collection inscription_id>",
  "supersedes": "<current head inscription_id>",

#### Conflict resolution for simultaneous updates

When two `collection-update` ops referencing the same `supersedes` head are inscribed at the same block
height, the canonical ordering rule applies: `tx_index_in_block ASC`. The earlier-indexed tx wins.
The later op is treated as an orphaned branch and MUST be rejected by indexers.

### 4.8 auction

Auction-native intent. Use this op when auction behavior should be explicit and independently queryable,
even without a list op.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "auction",
  "inscription_id": "<txid>i<vout>",
  "seller": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "reserve_price": "<koinu>",
  "start_price": "<koinu>",
  "currency": "DOGE",
  "auction_mode": "time_based",
  "min_bid_increment": "<koinu>",
  "start_ts": 1700000000,
  "expiry": 1700007200,
  "collection_id": "<collection inscription_id>",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "nonce": "<optional string>",
  "ts": 1700000000
}
```

#### Field Rules

- `auction_mode` is REQUIRED.
- `expiry` is REQUIRED and MUST be > `start_ts`.
- `min_bid_increment` is REQUIRED and MUST be > 0.
- `seller` MUST equal the current UTXO owner of `inscription_id` in indexer state at this block height
  (same address-match rule as `list`, see Section 8).
- `auction_mode` values:
  - `time_based`: highest valid non-expired bid wins at/after expiry.
  - `seller_can_accept_early`: seller may settle any valid bid before expiry.
  - `no_early_accept`: settlement before expiry is INVALID.
- **Optional `co_sellers`**: same semantics as `list` (MUST-104, MUST-105).

#### Inline Example

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "auction",
  "inscription_id": "1111222233334444555566667777888899990000aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffffi0",

### 4.9 offer

Private push-style offer targeted to a specific inscription or collection.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "offer",
  "offer_target_type": "inscription",
  "inscription_id": "<txid>i<vout>",
  "collection_id": "<collection inscription_id>",
  "target_seller": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "buyer": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "price": "<koinu>",
  "currency": "DOGE",
  "offer_fee": "<koinu>",
  "fee_recipient": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "expiry": 1700007200,
  "list_id": "<optional list inscription_id bound to this offer>",
  "auction_id": "<optional auction inscription_id bound to this offer>",
  "psdt": "<base64 PSDT>",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "nonce": "<optional string>",
  "ts": 1700000000
}
```

#### Field Rules

- `offer_target_type` REQUIRED: `"inscription"` or `"collection"`.
- If `offer_target_type` is `"inscription"`, `inscription_id` is REQUIRED.
- If `offer_target_type` is `"collection"`, `collection_id` is REQUIRED.
- `target_seller` is optional. If present, only that seller can accept.
- `offer_fee` is REQUIRED and MUST be > 0.
- `fee_recipient` is REQUIRED.
- `fee_recipient` SHOULD equal `target_seller` when `target_seller` is present.
- **Optional `list_id` / `auction_id`**: when present, the offer is explicitly bound to that listing or
  auction; indexers MUST enforce MUST-100 on `settle` when both the offer reference and settle reference
  are present.
- Expired offers MUST NOT be eligible for acceptance or settlement.

#### Offer Fee Anti-Spam Mechanism

- Minimum recommended `offer_fee`: `"100000000"` koinu (1 DOGE).
- Indexers and wallets SHOULD deprioritize or hide offers whose `offer_fee` is below the minimum.
- Collections MAY publish preferred minimums via `default_auction_settings.min_offer_fee`.
- `bid_fee` remains optional in the current draft, but wallets/indexers MAY apply similar policy to bids.

}
```

#### Seller Response Rules

- `counteroffer` MUST reference an existing active offer.
- `accept` MUST reference an active offer or counteroffer.
- `decline` MUST reference an active offer or counteroffer.
- Only the controlling seller of the target inscription may issue counteroffer/accept/decline.
  Controlling seller = current UTXO owner of the targeted inscription (see Section 8).
- An accepted target is terminal for negotiation state and MUST be marked closed.
- Accepted and declined branches MUST NOT be accepted again.
- Expired offers and counteroffers MUST NOT be accepted, declined, or countered.

### 4.11 transfer 

Explicit non-sale ownership transfer for provenance continuity. Use this op to document gifts, airdrops,
migrations, and other ownership changes that are not marketplace sales. A valid `transfer` op clears an
existing provenance gap from the given `transfer_txid` forward.

**This op does not require a prior listing.** It is the ÐMP bridge for off-protocol moves that the owner
wants to document on-chain retroactively or prospectively.

#### Schema

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "transfer",
  "inscription_id": "<txid>i<vout>",
  "from_address": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "to_address": "<Dogecoin address>",
  "transfer_type": "gift",
  "note": "<optional human-readable note, max 140 chars>",
  "transfer_txid": "<confirmed txid of the actual UTXO move>",
  "chain": "dogecoin",
  "ts": 1700000000
}
```

#### Field Rules

- `inscription_id` REQUIRED.
- `from_address` REQUIRED. MUST equal the previous UTXO owner of `inscription_id` before `transfer_txid`.
- `to_address` REQUIRED. MUST equal the new UTXO owner of `inscription_id` after `transfer_txid`.
- `transfer_type` REQUIRED. Allowed values: `gift`, `airdrop`, `migration`, `burn`, `other`.
- `transfer_txid` REQUIRED. Indexers MUST verify `inscription_id` moved from `from_address` to
  `to_address` in this confirmed transaction.
- `note` is optional, for human-readable context (collections, lore). Max 140 characters.
- A `transfer` op is itself a new inscription — it is NOT the same as the transfer transaction.
  It may be inscribed before or after the move, but `transfer_txid` MUST be confirmed before indexers
  accept the provenance gap closure.
- A transfer gap closure requires 6 confirmed blocks on `transfer_txid` (same rule as settle).

#### Provenance Gap Closure Rule

When a valid `transfer` op is indexed:
1. If `provenance_gap = true` for `inscription_id` due to the spending of the UTXO in `transfer_txid`,
   indexers MUST set `provenance_gap = false` and record the restoration event.
2. Subsequent ownership is tracked from `to_address` forward.
3. A `transfer` op that does NOT match confirmed on-chain reality for `transfer_txid` MUST be rejected.

#### Inline Example

```json
{
  "p": "Ð:MP",
  "v": "1.0",
  "op": "transfer",
  "inscription_id": "aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff0000111122223333444455556666777788889999i0",

### 4.14 DogeTag Offers (OP_RETURN signaling extension)

ÐMP DogeTag Offers are a lightweight **signal**, not a replacement for ÐMP `offer`. The normative extension is
[dogetag-offers.md](dogetag-offers.md).

Rules:

- A DogeTag Offer **MUST NOT** be treated as escrow or settlement.
- A full ÐMP `offer` **MAY** reference a DogeTag signal via `tag_txid`.
- Wallets and indexers **SHOULD** surface DogeTags as buy-interest pings with recipient attention amounts.
- Marketplaces **MUST** keep normal ÐMP `offer`, `accept`, and `settle` rules authoritative.

---

## 5. Creator-Signed Manifests

Collection and collection-update signatures follow deterministic canonical JSON signing.

1. Remove `sig` and `sig_msg` from the JSON object.
2. Sort all object keys lexicographically at every nesting level.
3. Serialize to canonical JSON (no insignificant whitespace, UTF-8).
4. Apply Dogecoin signed-message prefix and double-SHA256 hash.
5. Verify recovered signer equals `creator_address`.

For `explicit` and `creator_signed` membership modes, `signed_list.sig` SHOULD also be verified when
determining whether inscriptions are members of collections.

---

## 6. Signature Canonicalization

The following canonicalization process MUST be used for all `sig` fields:

1. Start from the full JSON object.
2. Remove signature transport fields: `sig` and `sig_msg`.
3. Serialize canonical JSON:
   - Lexicographically sorted object keys at every level.
   - No insignificant whitespace.
   - UTF-8 encoding.
   - Numbers as JSON numbers; koinu amounts as strings per spec.
4. Build Dogecoin signed-message payload:
   `"\x19Dogecoin Signed Message:\n"` + CompactSize(byte_length) + canonical_json_bytes
5. Double-SHA256 the prefixed payload.
6. Verify signature recovery against expected signer address.

`sig_msg`, when present, contains the hex-encoded result of step 3 (canonical JSON bytes before prefixing).
This is a convenience field for inspection only. Indexers MUST always recompute step 3 independently and
MUST NOT accept `sig_msg` as a substitute for canonical recomputation.

Implementations MUST reject signatures produced from non-canonical serialization.

---

## 7. Listing State Machine

Every `list` and `auction` op transitions through the following states. Indexers MUST track these states
deterministically:

```text
ACTIVE states:
  listed          - list op confirmed, inscription UTXO still owned by seller
  auction_live    - auction op confirmed, within start_ts..expiry window, no settlement

TERMINAL states:
  settled         - valid settle op confirmed (first valid settle wins)
  cancelled       - valid cancel op confirmed
  invalidated     - inscription UTXO spent without valid ÐMP settlement/transfer path
  expired         - listing_type=fixed_price and expiry timestamp passed with no settle
  expired_no_sale - auction_mode=time_based and expiry passed with no valid settle

PENDING states (provisional, not confirmed):
  pending_settle  - settle op in mempool, awaiting confirmation depth
  pending_cancel  - cancel op in mempool
```

### State Transition Rules

- `listed` → `settled`: valid settle op with confirmed settlement_txid (>= 6 blocks).
- `listed` → `cancelled`: valid cancel op with authorization.
- `listed` → `invalidated`: inscription UTXO spent without settle or transfer.
- `listed` → `expired`: `expiry` timestamp reached, no settle.
- `listed` → `listed` (re-list): new list op with same inscription_id supersedes the current listing.
  Only one ACTIVE list per inscription at any time; latest by canonical ordering wins.
- `auction_live` → `settled`: valid settle op after valid bid, respecting auction_mode.
- `auction_live` → `expired_no_sale`: expiry passed, no bids or all bids below reserve.
- `auction_live` → `cancelled`: valid cancel before any valid bid is received.
- `auction_live` → `invalidated`: inscription UTXO spent.

### Handling Active Bids on Re-list

When a new `list` op supersedes an existing active listing, all active bids against the previous listing
are AUTOMATICALLY INVALIDATED by the supersession (they reference a listing that is no longer active).
Active bids against `inscription_id` without a `list_id` backref remain visible but MUST be treated as
general intent — they do not force the seller to honor old terms.

---

## 8. Ownership Verification Model

Dogenals inscriptions are stored in the first input's `script_sig` of the inscription transaction. Ownership
is tracked by the indexer via satpoint-to-inscription mapping. The current owner of an inscription is the
address controlling the UTXO at the current satpoint of that inscription.

### 8.1 Seller Authorization for list and auction

MUST-011 (revised): The `seller` field MUST equal the address currently controlling the `inscription_id`
UTXO in the indexer's confirmed state at the block height of the list/auction inscription.

A `list` or `auction` op does NOT spend the inscription UTXO. It is a new inscription in its own
transaction. Ownership verification is done by address comparison against indexer state, not UTXO spend.

### 8.2 Auto-invalidation

When the inscription UTXO (the satpoint for `inscription_id`) is spent:
1. All active `list` and `auction` ops for that inscription MUST be marked `invalidated`.
2. If the spend has no valid ÐMP `settle` or `transfer` op in the same canonical context,
   `provenance_gap` is set to `true`.
3. On reorg, these invalidations are rolled back along with the spending block.

### 8.3 Controlling Seller for Negotiation Responses

The "controlling seller" for counteroffer/accept/decline is the current UTXO owner of the
target inscription at the block height of the response op. Indexers MUST verify this
dynamically — if ownership changed between the original listing and the response, the
response is INVALID (only the current owner can respond).

### 8.4 Cancel Authorization

See Section 4.4. Method A UTXO-based authorization: the cancel inscription tx MUST have at least
one input from the `canceller` address. Method B signature-based: `sig` field MUST verify to
`canceller` address via canonical signed-message process.

### 8.5 Multi-co-seller cancels

Listings and auctions MAY include **`co_sellers`** (Section 4.1 / 4.8). When they do, **MUST-104** and
**MUST-105** in Section 4.4 govern cancel transactions. Single-seller listings ignore this section.

---

## 9. Fixed vs Dynamic Collections

- `fixed` collections: bounded supply of member inscriptions.
- `dynamic` collections: unbounded or rule-evaluated expansion.

Allowed `criteria.mode` values:

| Collection type | Allowed modes                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| `fixed`         | `explicit`, `parent`, `range`    |
| `dynamic`       | `creator_signed`, `rule_based`   |

Slug format MUST match `^[a-z0-9-]+$` with max 64 characters. Slugs are unique per chain; earliest
confirmed inscription by canonical ordering wins.

---

## 10. Update Mechanism and Immutability Policy

`collection-update` is append-only through the `supersedes` chain.

**Permanently immutable fields** (MUST NOT change in any update):

- `slug`
- `chain`
- `type` (fixed CANNOT become dynamic)
- `parent_inscription_id` when set on the root `collection` (MUST NOT be altered or removed via
  `collection-update`; the field is only legal on the root [§4.5 `collection`](#45-collection) op)

**Conditionally immutable**:

- `supply` when `supply_locked = true`

**Mutable via collection-update**:

- `description`, `name`, `default_auction_settings`, `royalty_address`, `royalty_bps`
  (subject to vote if `requires_vote = true`)

---

## 11. DAO Voting Hook

If `requires_vote = true` on the collection, `collection-update` MUST include a valid `vote_proof`.
The referenced `vote` inscription MUST:
- Reference the same `collection_id`.
- Have `result = "approved"`.
- Have `vote_end` before the `collection-update` timestamp.
- Have a valid `sig` verifying to the collection's DAO authority.

---

## 12. Why ÐMP (and why centralized marketplaces are inferior)

ÐMP gives marketplaces eBay-like behavior without centralized trust:

- public listings and auctions
- private offers and seller negotiation workflow
- configurable auction modes
- shared settlement truth, competing frontend execution
- cross-marketplace royalty auditing

While any indexer can reconstruct raw ownership from chain data, only a standardized protocol like ÐMP
enables independent reconstruction of **market state** (active listings, bids, resolved auctions,
negotiation outcomes, royalty flows) with consistent rules across implementations.

### 12.1 Fee Model: Fully Marketplace-Controlled

- ÐMP does not collect platform fees.
- Marketplaces include their own fee outputs in the settlement transaction.
- `platform_fee` / `platform_fee_recipient` in `settle` makes these visible on-chain.
- The marketplace that closes the deal keeps its fee.

### 12.2 Intent vs. Execution — What ÐMP Does Not Guarantee

ÐMP is an **intent and proof layer**. It does NOT:
- Provide atomic execution or escrow (Dogecoin has no native smart contract escrow).
- Prevent a seller from listing on multiple venues simultaneously.
- Prevent a settlement from being broadcast before a cancel is confirmed.
- Force royalty payment (but DOES make non-payment visible and auditable).

What ÐMP DOES:
- Creates permanent on-chain records of intent.
- Enables any indexer to verify settlement proof against real transaction outputs.
- Makes all violations auditable — bad actors can be identified.
- Enables UI to surface trust signals ("ÐMP Verified" vs. "Provenance Broken").

See SECURITY.md for the full threat model and mitigation strategies.

## 13. Indexer Verification Rules

Any op failing a MUST rule is invalid.

### 13.1 Universal

- MUST-001: `p` equals `"Ð:MP"`.
- MUST-002: `v` is a recognized version. indexers accept `"1.0"`.
- MUST-003: `op` is recognized.
- MUST-004: valid UTF-8 JSON.
- MUST-005: unknown fields ignored (not errors).
- MUST-006: `chain` field, if present, MUST equal `"dogecoin"` on Dogecoin mainnet.
- MUST-007: canonical ordering tie-breaker: `block_height ASC`, `tx_index_in_block ASC`, `output_index ASC`.
- MUST-008: every koinu amount field where a **positive** integer is required MUST match `^[1-9][0-9]*$` and
  MUST parse to an integer **≤ 2^64 − 1**. Indexers MUST reject oversize strings, leading zeros, or non-digit
  characters as INVALID.
- MUST-102: `ts` sanity vs MTP (or documented `nTime` fallback) — Section 3.3.
- MUST-103: use each op’s own JSON `ts` for relative comparisons unless this spec names MTP(block) — Section 3.3.

### 13.2 list

- MUST-010: `inscription_id` exists in indexer state.
- MUST-011: `seller` equals the current UTXO owner of `inscription_id` at the list inscription's block
  height (address-match model — NOT UTXO spend). See Section 8.1.
- MUST-012: `price` is a valid positive integer string.
- MUST-013: only one ACTIVE list per inscription at any time; by canonical ordering, the latest list op
  supersedes any prior active listing.
- MUST-014: expired listings (past `expiry`) are inactive.
- MUST-015: auto-invalidate on inscription UTXO spend without valid settle/transfer path.
- MUST-016: if `listing_type` is `"auction"`, `auction_mode` MUST be a valid value.

### 13.3 bid

- MUST-020: `inscription_id` or `collection_id` MUST be present.
- MUST-021: referenced target exists in indexer state.
- MUST-022: `price` is a valid positive integer string.
- MUST-023: if `expiry` is present, expired bids MUST be treated as inactive and ineligible for settlement.
- MUST-024: if `bid_fee` is present, `fee_recipient` MUST be present.
- MUST-025: if `list_id` is present, the referenced listing MUST be active at the bid's block height.

### 13.4 settle

- MUST-030: `settlement_txid` exists in confirmed chain state with >= 6 blocks of confirmation depth
  (indexers MAY configure higher; MUST NOT accept < 1 confirmation as final).
- MUST-031: `inscription_id` transferred to `buyer` in `settlement_txid`.
- MUST-032: `seller` receives at least `price` koinu in `settlement_txid`.
- MUST-033: if `royalty_paid` is present, the actual royalty output in `settlement_txid` MUST be >=
  `floor(price * royalty_bps / 10000)`. Zero tolerance — claimed amounts MUST be present in the tx.
- MUST-034: if linked auction is `no_early_accept`, the **`ts` field on the settle inscription JSON**
  MUST be >= auction `expiry` (use inscription `ts`, not block time; MUST-103).
- MUST-035: if linked auction is `seller_can_accept_early`, settle MAY occur before expiry.
- MUST-036: **double-settle prevention**: the first valid settle by canonical ordering for a given
  `list_id` or `auction_id` wins. Subsequent settle ops for the same settled listing are INVALID.
- MUST-037: if `platform_fee` is present, `platform_fee_recipient` MUST be present and the
  corresponding output MUST exist in `settlement_txid`.
- MUST-096: `buyer` MUST NOT equal `seller` on `settle`.
- MUST-097: if `list_id` is present, the referenced `list` op’s `inscription_id` MUST equal the settle’s
  `inscription_id`; if `auction_id` is present, the referenced `auction` op’s `inscription_id` MUST equal the
  settle’s `inscription_id`.
- MUST-098: if `list_id` or `auction_id` is present, the settle’s `seller` MUST equal the `seller` on that
  referenced `list` or `auction` op.
- MUST-099: If `bid_id` references an `offer` inscription, that offer MUST exist, MUST NOT be expired for
  settlement per MUST-108, its `inscription_id` (when `offer_target_type` is `"inscription"`) MUST equal
  the settle’s `inscription_id`, and it MUST be in an **eligible** negotiation state (active or already
  `accept`ed chain leading to this settle).
- MUST-100: If `settle` references **`list_id` or `auction_id`** and **`bid_id`** resolves to an `offer` that
  includes optional **`list_id` / `auction_id`**, those fields MUST match the settle’s `list_id` /
  `auction_id` respectively (both sides present and equal, or both absent on the offer for that field).
- MUST-101: If `bid_id` resolves to an `offer`, settle `buyer` MUST equal that offer’s `buyer`. If `bid_id`
  resolves to an `accept`, settle `buyer` MUST equal the `buyer` on the **root `offer`** reached by following
  `target_id` from the accept through any `counteroffer` chain back to the originating `offer`.
- MUST-107: If the effective royalty basis is zero — the referenced `list` or `auction` has `royalty_bps`
  **`"0"`**, or the applicable **collection** manifest sets `royalty_bps` to **`"0"`** and no non-zero listing
  override exists — then `royalty_paid` MUST be absent or **`"0"`**; any positive claim is INVALID.

### 13.5 cancel

- MUST-040: `cancel_id` exists and references a non-terminal intent.
- MUST-041: canceller is authorized for target op (see Section 8.4 and Section 4.4).
- MUST-042: if `sig` is present, the signature MUST verify against `canceller` via canonical process.
- MUST-043: cancel is idempotent on already-terminal intents (settled, already-cancelled, expired).
- MUST-044: **`canceller` MUST be present** when using **Method B** (`sig`); for **v1.0** **Method A**
  (UTXO-only) cancels, `canceller` MAY be omitted when authorization is proven from inscription tx inputs
  (§4.4). If `canceller` is present, it MUST name the party authorized to cancel the target op.
- MUST-104: Multi-`co_sellers` list/auction cancel input requirements — Section 4.4.
- MUST-105: Full co-seller participation after active bid/offer on listing — Section 4.4.
- MUST-106: `reason` REQUIRED and MUST be one of `seller_request`, `expired`, `buyer_breach`,
  `admin_emergency`, `other` — Section 4.4.

### 13.6 collection

- MUST-050: `slug` unique per chain; earliest by canonical ordering wins slug registration.
- MUST-051: manifest `sig` MUST verify to `creator_address`.
- MUST-052: `explicit` mode requires valid `signed_list.sig` verifying to `creator_address`.
- MUST-053: `fixed` + `explicit` supply MUST equal `criteria.inscription_ids` list count when
  `supply_locked = true`.
- MUST-054: `royalty_bps` MUST be integer string in range `"0"` through `"1000"` (0%–10%).
- MUST-055: `default_auction_settings.auction_mode`, if present, MUST be a valid auction mode value.
- MUST-056: `slug` MUST match `^[a-z0-9-]+$` with max 64 characters.
- MUST-057: if `parent_inscription_id` is present, it MUST match the inscription_id pattern, MUST refer
  to an inscription the indexer can resolve, and (when the same *collection* inscription is indexed with
  DRC-721) MUST match a native DRC-721 `parent` tag in the *ord* trailer if one exists (same 36 B id); if
  DRC-721 `parent` and `parent_inscription_id` disagree, the op is **inconsistent** (MUST be rejected or
  flagged, per policy).
- MUST-058: `parent_inscription_id` MUST be omitted from `collection-update` `patch` and from any
  non-root `collection` use; only the root [§4.5 `collection`](#45-collection) op may carry the field.

### 13.7 collection-update

- MUST-060: `collection_id` exists in indexer state.
- MUST-061: `supersedes` MUST equal the current head inscription_id of the collection update chain.
  Competing updates to the same head are resolved by canonical ordering.
- MUST-062: `sig` MUST verify to the `creator_address` of the root collection.
- MUST-063: immutable fields (`slug`, `chain`, `type`, and `parent_inscription_id` on the root when set) MUST
  NOT be changed in `patch`.
- MUST-064: if `requires_vote = true` on collection, `vote_proof` MUST be present and valid.
- MUST-065: `patch` MUST NOT contain `parent_inscription_id` (see [§4.6](#46-collection-update)).

### 13.8 vote

- MUST-070: references existing `collection_id` in indexer state.
- MUST-071: `sig` MUST verify to the collection's DAO authority address.
- MUST-072: `vote_end` > `vote_start`.
- MUST-073: `result` is `"approved"` or `"rejected"`.

### 13.9 auction

- MUST-074: `auction_mode` is required and valid.
- MUST-075: `expiry` is required and > `start_ts`.
- MUST-076: `seller` MUST equal the current UTXO owner of `inscription_id` at this block height.
- MUST-077: `min_bid_increment` is required and > 0.

### 13.10 offer and seller responses

- MUST-080: `offer_target_type` required and valid.
- MUST-081: `inscription` target requires `inscription_id`; `collection` target requires `collection_id`.
- MUST-082: `offer_fee` required, positive integer string, > 0.
- MUST-083: `fee_recipient` required for offer.
- MUST-084: `counteroffer` references active, non-expired offer.
- MUST-085: `accept` references active, non-expired offer or counteroffer.
- MUST-086: `decline` references active, non-expired offer or counteroffer.
- MUST-087: only controlling seller (current UTXO owner) can counteroffer/accept/decline.
- MUST-088: accepted or declined negotiation MUST NOT be accepted again (terminal state).
- MUST-108: For settlement via an `offer` referenced through `bid_id`, let **MTP** be the median time past of
  the block confirming the **`settle` inscription**. The offer’s **`expiry`** MUST satisfy **`expiry` ≥ MTP**
  (offer not expired at settle confirmation). The same rule applies to the effective offer after resolving
  an `accept` / `counteroffer` chain to the root `offer`’s `expiry`.

### 13.11 transfer

- MUST-090: `inscription_id` exists in indexer state.
- MUST-091: `transfer_txid` confirmed with >= 6 blocks.
- MUST-092: `inscription_id` moved from `from_address` to `to_address` in `transfer_txid`.
- MUST-093: `from_address` MUST equal the previous UTXO owner of `inscription_id` before
  `transfer_txid`.
- MUST-094: if a `provenance_gap` exists for this inscription from `transfer_txid`, a valid `transfer`
  op MUST close it.
- MUST-095: `transfer_type` MUST be one of `gift`, `airdrop`, `migration`, `burn`, `other`.

### 13.12 Validation Priority Order

When multiple MUST rules fail, implementations SHOULD report the first failing rule in this priority:

1. Universal envelope rules (MUST-001 through MUST-008, MUST-102, MUST-103)
2. Ownership and UTXO-control rules (MUST-011, MUST-013, MUST-015, MUST-076)
3. Operation shape and required-field rules (MUST-010, MUST-020, MUST-040, MUST-050, MUST-060,
   MUST-070, MUST-074, MUST-080–083, MUST-090)
4. Negotiation lifecycle rules (MUST-084–088, MUST-100)
5. Settlement integrity rules (MUST-030–037, MUST-096–099, MUST-101, MUST-107, MUST-108)
6. Cancel rules (MUST-040–044, MUST-104–106)
7. Collection governance and immutability rules (MUST-051–058, MUST-061–065)

---

## 14. Security Considerations

See SECURITY.md for the full threat model, attack vectors, and mitigations.

Key highlights:

### 14.1 Reorg Safety

- Indexers MUST support rollback of all ÐMP state transitions.
- Savepoint-based rollback (as implemented in wonky-dogeord style indexers) is acceptable.
  Recommended savepoint interval: every 10 blocks, min 5 savepoints deep (~50 block reorg depth).
- Rollback-plus-replay is the alternative model. Both MUST produce identical final state.
- All provenance_gap events and listing state transitions MUST be revertible.
- If a confirmed `settlement_txid` or `transfer_txid` later **leaves the best chain** (reorg), indexers MUST
  downgrade any `settle` / `transfer` op that depended on it from FINAL to INVALID or PENDING, re-open affected
  listing/negotiation state per replay, and MUST NOT keep a “settled” flag driven only by the orphaned tx.

### 14.2 PSDT Stale Invalidation on Cancel

When cancelling a listing advertised with a PSDT:

1. Seller moves inscription to new UTXO via self-transfer transaction.
2. Existing PSDT tied to old inscription UTXO is now invalid (input spent).
3. Previous list op auto-invalidates via MUST-015.
4. Seller inscribes new list op from new UTXO with fresh PSDT if desired.

This sequence prevents stale PSDTs from being executable after cancellation.

### 14.3 Mempool Handling

- Mempool-based ÐMP ops are PROVISIONAL and MUST be clearly marked as such.
- Indexers MUST NOT apply permanent state changes from unconfirmed ops.
- UI SHOULD show mempool ops as "pending" — not "active" or "settled".
- On replacement or reorg, mempool ops MUST be fully retracted.

---

## 15. Edge Cases

- **Conflicting collection slugs**: earliest inscription by canonical ordering wins.
- **Auction expiry race (time_based)**: bid confirmed at block after expiry is still valid — expiry is
  evaluated at confirmation time, not mempool admission time.
- **Forbidden early settlement (no_early_accept)**: settle before expiry is INVALID regardless of payment
  correctness.
- **Simultaneous competing settle ops**: first valid settle by canonical ordering wins (MUST-036).
- **Re-list with active bids**: new list supersedes old; prior bids against `list_id` are invalidated.
- **Offer/bid expiry**: use **MUST-108** (MTP at settle confirmation vs offer `expiry`) and **MUST-103**
  (prefer inscription JSON `ts` for op-to-op comparisons, not miner block time).
- **Royalty underpayment**: a settle that claims royalties but pays less than
  `floor(price * royalty_bps / 10000)` is INVALID per MUST-033.
- **Zero-price settle**: a settle with `price = "0"` is a valid settlement only if the listing price was
  also `"0"`. Indexers MUST reject settles where `price` does not match verified on-chain payment amount.

### 15.1 Auction Timing Edge Cases

**Example A**: late bid near expiry (time_based)
- expiry = 1700007200; bid confirms at block time 1700007203.
- Bid is VALID — expiry is checked at confirmation time, not broadcast time.
- Indexers SHOULD mark pre-confirmation UI state as provisional.

**Example B**: forbidden early settlement (no_early_accept)
- settle op block timestamp 1700007100, expiry 1700007200.
- MUST-034 fails; settle is INVALID regardless of payment correctness.

**Example C**: allowed early settlement (seller_can_accept_early)
- settle op block timestamp 1700007100, expiry 1700007200.
- Valid if MUST-030–033, MUST-035 all pass.

### 15.2 Provenance Gap Edge Cases

**Example D**: off-protocol transfer
- Inscription UTXO spent without valid ÐMP op.
- `provenance_gap = true` from that txid forward.

**Example E**: gap closure via transfer op
- `transfer` op inscribed with matching `transfer_txid`.
- Indexers verify and set `provenance_gap = false` for that inscription.

**Example F**: mempool/reorg gap reversal
- Provisional provenance_gap detected in mempool.
- Replacement/reorg removes triggering spend.
- Indexer MUST remove provisional gap event and recompute from canonical chain state.

### 15.3 Settlement reference edge cases

- **Mismatched `list_id` / `auction_id`**: a settle whose `list_id` or `auction_id` points at a different
  `inscription_id` than the settle body is INVALID (MUST-097).
- **Same-address buyer and seller**: INVALID (MUST-096); use `op: "transfer"` to document non-sale moves.
- **Offer / accept path without `list_id`**: some private sales settle from an `offer` → `accept` chain without
  a concurrent `list`. MUST-097/MUST-098 do not apply when **both** `list_id` and `auction_id` are absent;
  MUST-030–033 and MUST-031/MUST-032 remain authoritative for on-chain reality.
- **Integer overflow in royalty math**: `price * royalty_bps` MUST NOT be computed in a type that wraps;
  use bigint or `checked_mul` (see §4.3 notes).
- **`bid_id` → `offer` linkage**: MUST-099–MUST-101; optional offer fields `list_id` / `auction_id` enable
  MUST-100 cross-checks against settle.
- **Zero listing royalty**: MUST-107 when `royalty_bps` is `"0"` on the referenced list/auction.

### 15.4 Cancel and timestamp edge cases

- **`reason` enum**: MUST-106; legacy strings MAY be displayed as `seller_request` but MUST NOT be minted anew.
- **`ts` drift**: MUST-102 rejects ops whose `ts` is far from the confirming block’s MTP (clock abuse / spam).
- **Multi-`co_sellers`**: partial cancel without all required inputs is INVALID after MUST-104/MUST-105.

## 17. Launch Draft Summary

ÐMP v1.0 is the first Dogenals marketplace launch draft. It includes:

- Marketplace intents for `list`, `bid`, `auction`, `offer`, seller responses, `settle`, `cancel`, and `transfer`.
- Collection manifests and `collection-update` rules.
- Optional root `collection.parent_inscription_id`, aligned with DRC-721 native `parent` / UTXO validation.
- Creator signatures, canonical ordering, provenance gap handling, and settlement verification.
- ÐMP DogeTag Offers by reference as a lightweight OP_RETURN signaling extension.

This specification is pre-launch. No prior ÐMP mint or deployment constrains this launch draft.
